1) The files 'predictions.ipynb' and 'features.ipynb' constain the working models of univarirate and multivariate forecasting models on the weather database, gathered from 'vissualcrossing.com'
2) Other files constain various methods of forecasting, using various methods like including the cos function of the month/year time series values as a feature, to highlight the seasonality of the data (Not usefull in stock prediction, but useful for seasonal data like weather parameters)
3) Financial data was mostly gathered from yfinance API.
